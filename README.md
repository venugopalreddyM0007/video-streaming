Optimized Video Search: Implemented debouncing to improve search performance.

- Efficient API Polling: Used to keep data up-to-date with minimal server load.

- Nth-Level Comments: Enabled a dynamic comments section with multiple nested levels.

- State Management: Utilized Redux Toolkit for effective state management with cache implemented to

optimize data retrieval.

- Higher-Order Components (HOCs): Applied HOCs for reusable and maintainable code.

- Optimized Code Practices: Focused on writing clean, standardized code for enhanced performance and maintainability.

The project includes caching with Redux to reduce redundant API requests and improve data efficiency. This showcases my ability to build complex, high-performance web applications while following best coding practices.
